# EDA-HOTEL-ANALYSIS

The "EDA-HOTEL-ANALYSIS" project is an exploratory data analysis of hotel booking data. The project aims to gain insights and understand patterns in the dataset to support business decision-making.

Project Objective
The objective of the project is to analyze the hotel booking data and provide actionable insights to the client for achieving their business goals.

Data
The dataset used for analysis contains information about hotel bookings, including guest demographics, booking details, stay duration, and other relevant variables. The dataset is sourced from [source_name].

Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach to conduct exploratory data analysis. It includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data formatting, and removing duplicates to ensure data quality.
Data Exploration: Analyzing various variables and their relationships through statistical summaries, visualizations, and descriptive statistics.
Feature Engineering: Creating new variables or transforming existing variables to extract additional insights from the data.
Data Visualization: Creating charts, graphs, and plots to visualize patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
Insights Generation: Drawing meaningful insights and identifying key findings from the analysis.
Recommendations: Providing actionable recommendations to the client based on the insights derived from the data analysis.
Findings and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following key findings and recommendations have been identified:

Majority of the bookings are for city hotels, suggesting a higher demand for urban accommodations. Allocate more targeting funds and resources to promote city hotels.
High cancellation rates may be attributed to strict deposit policies. Consider revising deposit policies to reduce cancellations and improve booking conversions.
Peak months for hotel bookings are between May and August, coinciding with the summer period. Focus marketing efforts and offers during these months to maximize occupancy and revenue.
Western Europe contributes the largest number of guests. Invest a significant portion of the marketing budget in targeting Western European countries to attract more bookings.
Implement strategies to increase returning guests, such as loyalty programs, personalized offers, and post-stay follow-ups. Enhancing guest loyalty can lead to improved business growth and revenue.
Address outliers in the Average Daily Rate (ADR) variable to ensure accurate pricing and revenue management.
Consider offering special deals and packages for longer stays (more than 15 days) to attract guests and optimize revenue during low occupancy periods.
Conclusion
The EDA-HOTEL-ANALYSIS project provides valuable insights into the hotel booking data, allowing the client to make informed decisions to achieve their business objectives. By implementing the recommended strategies, the client can enhance guest satisfaction, optimize revenue, target the right market segments, and improve overall business performance.
